Calendar
==========

A dependency free javascript library for creating calendars. 
Unlike normal calendar plugins, this just provides the business logic to 
generate the calendar data. 
Library consumers are responsible for providing the UI layer.

This is not ment to be an out-of-the-box solution, instead the goal is to provide a solid fundation for building calendar widgets.

Calendar
==========

Calendar is a javascript component for creating calendars.
Unlike most calendar plugins, this one doesn't generate markup, it just generates the calendar data as a javascript object.
You need to provide a view (function, backbone view, angular directive, etc) and render the data in whichever way you want.

This is not ment to be an out-of-the-box solution, instead the goal is to provide a solid fundation where to build a calendar widget.
The Calendar builder is build using pure javascript so you don't need to depend on any 3rd party libraries.

**This is work in progress**
